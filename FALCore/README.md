# FALCore VBA Library

Welcome to the FALCore VBA Library, a collection of powerful and reusable modules and classes designed to accelerate Microsoft Excel development.

## Project Structure

The library is organized into two main folders:

- **/Classes**: Contains object-oriented class modules (`.cls` files) that provide advanced functionalities.
  - `FalPlot`: A powerful class for creating and manipulating charts.
- **/Modules**: Contains standard procedural modules (`.bas` files) with a wide range of helper functions.

## Getting Started

To use the FALCore library in your VBA project, you can import the desired `.cls` and `.bas` files.
